 ## Flask Application Design for Brand Identification from Images

### HTML Files

**1. index.html**
- This is the main HTML file that users will interact with.
- It should contain a form that allows users to upload an image for brand identification.
- The form should include a file input field and a submit button.

**2. results.html**
- This HTML file will display the results of the brand identification process.
- It should include a section to display the uploaded image and a section to display the identified brand.

### Routes

**1. /**
- This route will handle the GET request for the main page (index.html).

**2. /upload**
- This route will handle the POST request for uploading an image.
- It should save the uploaded image to a specified location on the server and redirect the user to the results page.

**3. /identify**
- This route will handle the GET request for the results page (results.html).
- It should use the saved image to perform brand identification and display the results on the page.

### Additional Considerations

- The application should include a way to handle errors, such as when an image cannot be uploaded or when the brand identification process fails.
- The application should be designed to be responsive and work well on different devices and screen sizes.
- The application should follow best practices for security and data protection.
